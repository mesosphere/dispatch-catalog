**Accelerate your CI/CD**

[D2iQ's Dispatch](https://d2iq.com/solutions/ksphere/dispatch) helps organizations deliver CI/CD pipelines that support faster code development and deployment. The Dispatch catalog is a repository of libraries that Dispatch users can import into their pipelines.  Leverage the Dispatch catalog to accelerate common integration tasks such as testing, artifact management, kubernetes resource usage and unit test execution. Watch the [repo](https://github.com/mesosphere/dispatch-catalog) to leverage additional resources as they become available.

As the official [Dispatch](https://docs.d2iq.com/ksphere/dispatch/latest/) catalog, this currently hosts our Starlark standard libraries however, this will grow to include other resources and languages.

Check out the [Starlark standard library documentation](./starlark/) for more information.
